## _Technologies and Languages used_

- The most important technology used here is Unity, I have used Unity's Universal Render Pipeline along with appropriate and necessary post processing effects.
- The level design contains a low poly environment and a 3D humanoid character which was made in Unity itself.
- The language used for coding is C#.
- The animations were generated using mixamo.
